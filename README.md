We work on the handwritten-digits MNIST dataset to perform feature extraction, Density Estimation and Bayesian Classification on both the training and test data.
The training data given has 11548 datapoints each consisting of an image of size 28*28 pixels which contains either of the two digits “3” or “7”. With the help of the training set, we try to arrive at a decision rule for selecting a digit label, given its attributes. Once this rule is achieved, we try to find the error with the help of this rule over the training and test dataset with the help of given priors.

Data:
The handwritten-digit MNIST dataset consists of 11548 training samples and 2886 test samples. The data consists of two classes namely digit “3” and “7”. Each data sample is an image of 28*28 pixels where each pixel shows the density of the handwriting on it.
